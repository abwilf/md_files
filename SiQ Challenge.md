## LP Meeting Notes

baselines
    multimodal
        transformer
        old style: takes features
    unimodal
        text
        video
        audio

features
    openface
    word alignment

evaluation
    teams disclose the external data you use
    in our presentation: disclose subgroups

timeline
    march 27: notification of acceptance
    end of june: when submissions are due for our workshop
    3 weeks for us to review (we may extend)
    august 13: (camera ready for proceedings)

follow up with LP re: intel money for workshop march 30

no matter what
    program committee
    evaluation

start an initial list of program committee

spotlight talks (10 mins) + posters: people submit as many as they want


Organizing
- LP will chat with Evonne. If she's open to co-leading and the other conditions we talked about, we'll merge with her ASI workshop.
- The above will influence our speaker invitations.

Proposal
- We'll write a proposal now as if we will not be merging. Leena and I will write a draft and send by Friday.

Debiasing
- We'll start off by getting a "gold rematching". For each question and correct answer, we'll trim down the set of candidate incorrect answers to the top K that confuse the text-only model the most. Then, given the video, question, correct answer, and this set of candidates, a human will output which element in the set should be the incorrect answer, or whether none are valid.
- In parallel, we'll be implementing strategy 1: adversarially matching automatically using the method from VCR and strategy 2: matching correct answers in the way described above except without the video, so it's much faster. We'll have two metrics for evaluating each strategy: (1) How close to random the text model does, and (2) How well each strategy recovers the gold labels
- Our goal is to verify that one of the two strategies works by Feb 10, so we know there's a good path before we hear about acceptance

social-IQ 2, challenge, baseline debiasing
    goal
        ICCV deadline (when??)

    motivation
        want to clean up and get the social-iq data ready and accepted for a grand challenge which we'll hold in october to stimulate interest from the field
        want to put out the social-iq 2.0 paper + adversarial debiasing

    approach
        get workshop speakers: start Jan 10
